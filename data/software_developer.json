Dutzende Software-Komponenten spielen zusammen, um die angebotenen Dienste zu erbringen. Wir gründen ein neues Team, um diese Maschine besser zu betreuen, zu überwachen und das vorhandene Tooling und den Automatisierungsgrad zu verbessern. Dabei setzen wir vor allem auf Kubernetes Operatoren und cloud-native Software wie ArgoCD, OpenBAO, Prometheus, usw. Eigene in-house Entwicklungen sind ebenfalls üblich.  </p>\n<p>Wie bei einem Raumschiff oder Flugzeug brauchen wir aber nicht nur Mechaniker mit Ölkannen, sondern auch ein Team aus Ingenieuren, die den Gesamtprozess kontinuierlich verbessern, neue Tools bauen wo es nötig ist, und den anderen Teams alles bereitstellen was sie brauchen, um gute Arbeit zu machen. (wie zum Beispiel dem Customer Support, Produkt-Entwicklern oder den Operations Teams).  </p>\n<p>Zu Grunde liegt der Gedanke und das Ziel bei einem selbst-heilenden \"desired state\"-System zu landen, das per GitOps gesteuert wird und allen Produkten und Komponenten einheitliche Prozesse und eine wiederverwendbare Tool-Landschaft bietet.  </p>\n<p>Wir helfen anderen Teams, sofern nötig, bei dieser Umstellung - inklusive eventueller Containerisierung, immutable infrastructure, idempotenter Schnittstellen, usw. Im Platform Flight Engineering Team wird man sowohl Softwareentwicklung, Betrieb als auch Infrastruktur-Engineering finden. Unsere Flight Engineers werden außerdem in anderen Teams regelmäßig \"mitfliegen\", um den dort jeweils vorhandenen Maschinenraum besser zu verstehen.  </p>\n<p>Für dieses Team suchen wir Verstärkung. Am besten passt Du, wenn Du IT-Plattform-Betrieb beherrschst, aber grundsätzlich anstrebst, robuste Software-Agenten zu bauen, die den Betrieb allein übernehmen können. Entwicklung von Tools für den gesamten Lifecycle von Cloud-Produkten und -Plattformen. Zu deinen Aufgaben wird Folgendes gehören:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entwicklung von Kubernetes-Operatoren für den autonomen Betrieb von Software-Komponenten.</li>\n<li>Entwicklung von APIs, Tools und Komponenten, um andere Teams bei ihrer Arbeit zu unterstützen.</li>\n<li>Betreuung von Produktplattformen inkl. On-Call (natürlich mit dem Ziel, dass die Software die ganze Arbeit macht).</li>\n<li>Code Reviews.</li>\n<li>Begleitung anderer Teams bei ihrer Arbeit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"qualifikationen\">Qualifikationen</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Kenntnisse in der Softwareentwicklung, bevorzugt mit GoLang.</li>\n<li>Kenntnisse von Cloud-Umgebungen und Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Agiles Mindset, Erfahrung mit modernen Software-Entwicklungs-Methoden.</li>\n<li>Erfahrung im Betrieb von IT-Plattformen auf Linux- und Kubernetes-Basis.</li>\n<li>Fließendes Englisch in Wort und Schrift.</li>\n<li>Deutsch auf B2+ Niveau.</li>\n<li>\"Show must go on\"-Mentalität.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hinweis:</strong> Zum Ende des Bewerbungsprozesses müssen Kandidaten einer Sicherheitsüberprüfung unterzogen werden. Dein Einverständnis dafür wird rechtzeitig im Prozess erfragt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hybrides Arbeitsmodell mit Homeoffice-Möglichkeit.</li>\n<li>Flexible Arbeitszeiten durch Vertrauensarbeitszeit.</li>\n<li>An einigen Standorten eine bezuschusste Kantine und verschiedene kostenfreie Getränke.</li>\n<li>Moderne Büroflächen mit sehr guter Verkehrsanbindung.</li>\n<li>Diverse Mitarbeiterrabatte für Aktivitäten und Produkte.</li>\n<li>Mitarbeiterevents wie Sommer- und Winterfeiern, sowie Workshops.</li>\n<li>Zahlreiche Weiterbildungs- und Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten.</li>\n<li>Verschiedene Gesundheitsangebote, wie Sport- und Gesundheitskurse.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"über-ionos\">Über IONOS</h2>\n<p>IONOS ist der führende europäische Digitalisierungs-Partner für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU).

The digital threat landscape is ever-changing and as the cyber security industry reacts and adapts to changes, so too do the malware authors.  Our unique micro-virtualization technology ensures that customers are protected from even the most bleeding edge cyber security threats. That micro-virtualization technology forms a key pillar in a wider cyber security suite that we're actively developing. </p><p>To see what our engineering teams are working on, check out our technical blogs: <a href=\"https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/blog</a></p><p></p><p>Our history:</p><p>Inspired by the isolation principles of traditional virtualization, our team known then as Bromium, created a game-changing technology called micro-virtualization to protect end users against advanced malware. Every task the user performs, such as opening a document or clicking on a link, is isolated in its own micro-VM, with access to just the resources required for that task, and existing just for the life of the task. Protection is thus provided through isolation, without relying on detection, hence reliably defending the user from polymorphic and even zero-day malware. </p><p>Bromium was acquired by HP Inc on 19 September 2019 forming HP Wolf Security.  </p><p>For more information, visit our website: <a href=\"https://www.hp.com/uk-en/security/endpoint-security-solutions.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hp.com/uk-en/security/endpoint-security-solutions.html</a></p><p></p><p>Job -</p>Software<p></p><p>Schedule -</p>Full time<p></p><p>Shift -</p>No shift premium (United Kingdom)<p></p><p>Travel -</p><p></p><p>Relocation -</p><p></p><p>Equal Opportunity Employer (EEO) - </p><p></p><p>HP, Inc. provides equal employment opportunity to all employees and prospective employees, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, sexual orientation, age, disability, or status as a protected veteran, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic predisposition or carrier status, uniformed service status, political affiliation or any other characteristic protected by applicable national, federal, state, and local law(s).</p><p></p><p>Please be assured that you will not be subject to any adverse treatment if you choose to disclose the information requested.

Dutzende Software-Komponenten spielen zusammen, um die angebotenen Dienste zu erbringen. Wir gründen ein neues Team, um diese Maschine besser zu betreuen, zu überwachen und das vorhandene Tooling und den Automatisierungsgrad zu verbessern. Dabei setzen wir vor allem auf Kubernetes Operatoren und cloud-native Software wie ArgoCD, OpenBAO, Prometheus, usw. Eigene in-house Entwicklungen sind ebenfalls üblich.  </p>\n<p>Wie bei einem Raumschiff oder Flugzeug brauchen wir aber nicht nur Mechaniker mit Ölkannen, sondern auch ein Team aus Ingenieuren, die den Gesamtprozess kontinuierlich verbessern, neue Tools bauen wo es nötig ist, und den anderen Teams alles bereitstellen was sie brauchen, um gute Arbeit zu machen (wie zum Beispiel dem Customer Support, Produkt-Entwicklern oder den Operations Teams).  </p>\n<p>Zu Grunde liegt der Gedanke und das Ziel bei einem selbst-heilenden \"desired state\"-System zu landen, das per GitOps gesteuert wird und allen Produkten und Komponenten einheitliche Prozesse und eine wiederverwendbare Tool-Landschaft bietet.  </p>\n<p>Wir helfen anderen Teams, sofern nötig, bei dieser Umstellung - inklusive eventueller Containerisierung, immutable infrastructure, idempotenter Schnittstellen, usw. Im Platform Flight Engineering Team wird man sowohl Softwareentwicklung, Betrieb als auch Infrastruktur-Engineering finden.
